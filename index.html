      Welcome to my personal webpage. I am born and brought up in India. My family used to travel a lot in my childhood around the state Andrha Pradesh
      wherever my Dad used to work. Sometimes we studied same class in two different cities/towns. Maybe the reason I like to travel now. About I was around 13 years
      old we settled down in the city called Hyderabad. This city gave me opputunity to do my higher education. While studying in Hyderbad, made lots of friends and had
      a great time exporing the city. After finishing up my post graduation , I got married to this excellent person Achuta. At that time he was working in USA.
